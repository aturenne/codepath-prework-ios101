## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Apps:
- TikTok
    > Infinite Scrolling
    > Direct messages, replying to specific messages
    > For You Page algorithm
- VSCO
    > Photo editing properties
    > Reposting other images
- Instagram
    > Direct Messages, themed conversations
    > Recommended people to follow
    
Ideas:
- Goal-Tracking App that users could sign up for and follow other friends' goals. Users can write down short term and long term goals that can be placed into different categories (work, travel, mindfulness, fitness, education, etc.). Each goal could have checklist milestones that the user can add and check off when completed. There could also be a home page where a user can see other friends' goals and congratulate them when they complete one. 
- Tip Calculator App that could scan an itemized receipt and take information such as number of people paying to produce a total and tip for each person. It could display the tip amounts for different percentages for the user to choose from. This is an easy way to split meals with friends and know the cost without a hassle.
